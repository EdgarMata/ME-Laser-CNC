# ME-Laser-CNC
### What is ME-Laser CNC?
This project started out as a solution to solve a problem at the company where I work at the moment and has since evolved into something that I will share here...

I present to you my  ME - Laser CNC:

### Specifications
* Work Area 500 x 350 mm
* Total machine size of 740 x 560 x 260 mm
* 3.5 inch touch display
* 30W Diode Laser
* Adjustable laser height
* Web Browser controle interface
* Android Mobile App Interface
* USB PC Connection
* Board Makerbase MKS DLC32

### Controller Board
I use the Makerbase MKS DLC32 board as a controller, which is an offline engraving master control kit designed for desktop engraving machines. The hardware is equipped with a 32-bit high-speed ESP32 module, has built-in WIFI function, and directly drives a 3.5-inch touch-sensitive color dislpay.
It can perform fast engraving and also has a WEB page as a control interface.
This board can also be controlled by a mobile APP with various functions, as well as can be used with [LaserGRBL](https://lasergrbl.com/) and [LightBurn](https://lightburnsoftware.com/) PC software.

### 3D model and Bill of materials
If you're thinking about building your own ME - Laser CNC you can find everything you need here on [this](https://www.ifixgadget.pt/me-laser-cnc) page, I'll leave the link to the 3D model I made in Sketchup as well as the BOM of all materials and parts for 3D printing.
If you don't have a 3D printer you can use your favorite 3D printing service or I also provide a 3D printing service which also helps a lot with my projects, you can use the links on this site to contact me.
