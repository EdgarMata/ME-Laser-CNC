# Controller Board
I use the Makerbase MKS DLC32 board as a controller, which is an offline engraving master control kit designed for desktop engraving machines. The hardware is equipped with a 32-bit high-speed ESP32 module, has built-in WIFI function, and directly drives a 3.5-inch touch-sensitive color dislpay.
It can perform fast engraving and also has a WEB page as a control interface.
This board can also be controlled by a mobile APP with various functions, as well as can be used with LaserGRBL and LightBurn PC software.

For more information about this board you can consult the official page Makerbase as well as the GitHub page.
